## Configuration

### Environment Setup

To set up the environment for this project, you need to configure your GitHub token. Follow these steps:

1. Create a GitHub token with the necessary permissions from your GitHub account settings.
2. Set the token as an environment variable in your terminal or in your `.env` file:
   
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN='your_token_here'
   ```

3. Ensure that your application can access this environment variable to authenticate requests.

Remember to replace 'your_token_here' with your actual GitHub token.
